This week, I tried something different - I created my first Shiny app! Using recipes from [Mr. Boston Bartender's Guide](http://swizzle.ru/uploads/article_file/17/mr_boston.pdf), I created a simple application that helps you choose which cocktail to make based on the ingredients you have in your kitchen. Especially during quarantine, I'll have some extra time to discover and try out new recipes without leaving the house.

I have deployed the app using [shinyapps.io.](shinyapps.io) You can view the app [here](https://francislin.shinyapps.io/Cocktails/).
