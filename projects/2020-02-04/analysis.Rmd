# Introduction

This week's data comes from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/index.htm). I'll be honest, I know next to nothing about American football. I'm much more familiar with basketball. Nevertheless, I took a stab at seeing how home game attendance fluctuated throughout the history of each team in the NFL. 

# R Program

## Set up

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
# source utilities
source("../utilities.R")

# packages
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(scales)

# set data path
data_path <- set_data_path()

# create plot folder if doesn't exist
if (!dir.exists("./plot")) {dir.create("./plot")}
```

## Load Data
```{r load data, message=FALSE}
attendance <- read_csv(paste0(data_path, "attendance.csv"))
standings <- read_csv(paste0(data_path, "standings.csv"))
games <- read_csv(paste0(data_path, "games.csv"))
```

## Manipulate Data

```{r manipulate data, message=FALSE}

# clean up games
games <- games %>%
    select(year, week, home_team_name, home_team_city, away_team_name, away_team_city) %>%
    filter(!is.na(as.numeric(week))) %>%
    mutate(week = as.numeric(week))

# merge attendance and games to label home games
merged <- attendance %>% 
    drop_na(weekly_attendance) %>%
    left_join(games, by=(c("year", "week", "team_name"="home_team_name"))) %>%
    select(-home, -away, -total) %>%
    mutate(home = !is.na(home_team_city)) %>%
    select(-starts_with("home_"), -starts_with("away_"))

# filter and sort home game attendance
home_data <- merged %>%
    filter(home==TRUE) %>% 
    arrange(team_name, year, week) %>%
    group_by(team_name) %>%
    mutate(game_number=min(year) + (row_number()-1)/8)

# find average home game attendance throughout league
league_avg <- home_data %>%
    group_by(game_number) %>%
    summarise(avg=mean(weekly_attendance))
```

## Plot data

```{r plot data}
p <- ggplot(data=home_data) + 
    geom_line(aes(x=game_number, y=weekly_attendance), size=0.5, color="blue") +
    facet_wrap(~team_name, ncol = 8) + 
    geom_line(data=league_avg, aes(x=game_number, y=avg), size=0.5, color="green", alpha=0.5) +
    ylim(0, NA) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + 
    labs(x="Year", y="Attendance", title="Home Game Attendance in NFL")
```
